## Summary

A lot of our fault tree had faults in it that would be for real-world aircraft (i.e., physical faults) not simulated. We decided to redo this and made a start on the hazard analysis, where we have broken down potential hazards into categories:

- **Sensor Data Simulation Failures**
- **Autopilot System Simulation Failures**
- **Hazard Alerts Simulation Failures**
- **Data Display and Interference Simulation Issues**
- **Control Signal Verification Failures**
- **Redundant System Simulation Failures**
- **Miscellaneous Simulation Hazards**

## Progress

- **UI Design**: Drew up a paper design of the UI.
- **UI Implementation**: Started the implementation of the UI based on our specified design constraints.

## Next Steps

- Assign each team member a panel in the next meeting.
