## Summary

The group had written up many requirements prior to this meeting. We discussed them in depth during this session.

## Discussion Points

- **Requirements Discussion**: We talked about the requirements for our simulation and how they will align with the brief and DO-178C. We also ensured that we classified the requirements correctly. There were instances where some members felt a given requirement was functional while others classified it as non-functional.

- **Hazard Analysis**: Started developing a fault tree as part of our hazard analysis. We identified potential hazards and failure points in the system.

- **Design Constraints**: Based on our hazard analysis, we established design constraints to mitigate identified risks.

## Next Steps

- Continue refining and classifying requirements.
- Further develop the fault tree and hazard analysis.
- Implement the design constraints into our system design.
